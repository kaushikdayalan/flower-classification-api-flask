# flower-classification-api-flask

This is a basic api to use the flower classification model which is already trained.
I have used the resnet18 cnn.
Need to add the checkpoint file after training the model. Name the trained file as "trained_model.pt" 
and add it in the root directory of the repo.

To execute install the requirements and run the app.py file:
  ../../flower-classificatoin-api-flask>py app.py
  
  to start the server.
